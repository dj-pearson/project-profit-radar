## ⏳ Remaining Phase 4 Work (Optional)

### Small Contractor Operations Manual (1 guide - 10% remaining)

**Recommended approach:** This final piece can be created later as a downloadable PDF/resource rather than a full web page, as we've already created substantial cornerstone content with the two existing Ultimate Guides.

**Alternative:** The existing Financial Management Guide and Job Costing Guide effectively cover the core operations content that would be in an operations manual.
