# Plan: Optimize Real-time Financial Tracking Performance

This plan outlines the phases and tasks required to optimize the performance of the real-time financial tracking features.

---

## Phase 1: Performance Analysis and a plan for the next steps

### Tasks

-   [x] Task: Analyze the current implementation of the real-time financial tracking features to identify performance bottlenecks. This includes analyzing the frontend components, data fetching logic, and Supabase queries.
-   [~] Task: Establish baseline performance metrics for the real-time financial tracking features. This includes measuring the initial load time, update latency, and resource consumption.
-   [ ] Task: Create a detailed optimization plan based on the findings from the performance analysis. This plan should prioritize the identified bottlenecks and outline specific optimization strategies.
-   [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Performance Analysis and a plan for the next steps' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Optimization Implementation and Testing

### Tasks

-   [ ] Task: Implement the planned optimizations for data fetching, processing, and rendering of financial data. This may include optimizing TanStack Query configurations, improving data transformations, and enhancing the rendering performance of components.
-   [ ] Task: Optimize the use of Supabase real-time subscriptions to improve the efficiency of real-time updates.
-   [ ] Task: Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the optimizations do not introduce any regressions or bugs. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and manual testing.
-   [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Optimization Implementation and Testing' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Performance Validation and Documentation

### Tasks

-   [ ] Task: Measure the performance of the optimized financial tracking features and compare the results against the baseline metrics to validate the performance improvements.
-   [ ] Task: Document the implemented optimizations and the resulting performance gains. This documentation should be added to the project's technical documentation.
-   [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Performance Validation and Documentation' (Protocol in workflow.md)
