✅ SMB Construction Platform Feature Additions Checklist
1. RFIs (Request for Information)
What it is: A formal way for field or office teams to submit questions and get written responses from clients, architects, or vendors.
Why it's needed: Many SMBs use email for RFIs, which causes delays and confusion. A built-in RFI tracker improves accountability and helps keep project scope clear.

2. Submittals Workflow
What it is: A simple system to submit drawings, product data, or samples for approval before construction.
Why it's needed: Common on commercial projects. Even small GCs need a basic way to track who submitted what, when, and whether it was approved.

3. Punch List / Issue Tracking
What it is: A field tool to log quality issues or incomplete work, assign them, and track fixes.
Why it's needed: Closes the loop on walk-throughs. Easy punch list tracking ensures nothing gets missed during final inspections or client handoff.

4. PO & Expense Management
What it is: A lightweight purchase order module tied to job budgets, allowing users to log orders and match invoices/receipts.
Why it's needed: Prevents budget overruns and lost receipts. SMBs currently track this in spreadsheets—adding it simplifies financial control.

5. Client Selections
What it is: A visual catalog for clients to choose materials (e.g. countertops, tile) and track allowances.
Why it's needed: Avoids endless back-and-forth. Logs decisions in one place and triggers change orders automatically if needed.

6. Drawing Version Control
What it is: Plan uploads that auto-tag versions and highlight changes.
Why it's needed: Prevents crews from working off outdated drawings. Versioning is critical for avoiding rework and errors.

7. Crew Dispatch Calendar
What it is: Drag-and-drop scheduling for assigning crews to jobs and spotting conflicts.
Why it's needed: SMBs rarely have a clean way to see who’s scheduled where. This helps superintendents balance labor across sites.

8. GPS Time Tracking + Payroll Export
What it is: Geofenced mobile time tracking for crews and an exportable payroll report (or direct sync).
Why it's needed: Saves hours of manual entry and prevents false clock-ins. A must-have for labor cost control.

9. Offline Mobile Mode (Full Sync)
What it is: Full app functionality when offline, with auto-sync when back online.
Why it's needed: Construction sites often have poor signal. This ensures teams can still fill out reports, take photos, and stay productive.

10. Push Notifications & Alerts
What it is: Real-time alerts for task assignments, RFI replies, approvals, and client messages.
Why it's needed: Keeps users in the loop. Without this, important updates are missed and adoption suffers.

11. Client Portal Upgrades
What it is: A polished dashboard view for clients with progress, photos, selections, and invoices.
Why it's needed: Makes your product more professional and reduces client calls asking “what’s going on?” Improves customer trust.

12. Punchy In-App Reports
What it is: Easy-to-read, one-click reports (job cost summary, labor variance, overdue tasks).
Why it's needed: Small GCs often lack insight into how their jobs are doing. Simple reports help catch problems early.

13. Open API or Zapier Integration
What it is: Ability for users to connect their tools (e.g., estimating software, BI dashboards).
Why it's needed: Future-proofs your platform. Contractors want to avoid lock-in and connect tools they already use.

14. Selections Due Dates and Reminders
What it is: Automatic reminders for when client selections are overdue.
Why it's needed: Prevents job delays due to clients not picking things in time. Helps keep project timelines on track.

15. Customizable Inspection Checklists
What it is: Template-based inspections for safety, quality, and punch list items.
Why it's needed: Helps field teams stay compliant and consistent across jobs. A low-effort feature that shows polish.
